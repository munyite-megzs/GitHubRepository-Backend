# Introduction

This project is a web application designed to view repository data fetched from
the GitHub API. The application retrieves repositories, extracts the required
fields, stores them in a SQL Server database, and then sends the repositories to
the frontend for viewing.

Users can view repositories sorted by updatedAt date, number of stars, or number
of forks. Additionally, users can filter repositories by topic or language and
sort them in ascending or descending order based on the provided criteria.

The backend is built using ASP.NET Core Web API, while the frontend is developed
using ASP.NET Core MVC. Both applications will be hosted on Azure App Service.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the code up and running on your system:

# Installation process

1. Clone the repository using git clone [repository-url](https://MicrosoftLeapClassroom@dev.azure.com/MicrosoftLeapClassroom/GitRepositoryTracker/_git/GitRepositoryTracker-BackEnd)
2. Navigate to the project folder and open the solution file in Visual Studio.

# Software dependencies

.NET 6.0 or higher
SQL Server 2019 or higher(for the database)
Visual Studio 2022

# Configuration settings

Make sure to update the following settings in the [`appsettings.json`](appsettings.json) file according to your environment:

- **ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection** - Update with your database connection string.
- **GithubSettings:GitHubAccessToken** - Provide your GitHub Personal Access Token.

- **Jwt:Key, Jwt:Issuer, Jwt:Audience** - Update with appropriate values for JWT authentication.
  - **Jwt:Key**: This is a secret key used to sign the JWT, ensuring that the token is generated and verified by your application. It should be a strong and unique value, kept secret and not shared with anyone outside your application.
  - **Jwt:Issuer**: This property indicates the "issuer" of the JWT, which is usually your application's URL or a unique identifier for your application. The issuer is used to validate that the token was generated by your application and not by an attacker.
  - **Jwt:Audience**: This property specifies the "audience" of the JWT, which is usually the intended recipient of the token. In most cases, it will be the same as the issuer. The audience is used to ensure that the token is intended for your application and not for a different application.

  - **Size**: Repository size in KBs
